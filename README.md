# GIF Generator using Python 🐍🎞️

This project demonstrates how static images (frames) can be read, processed,
and combined into an animated GIF using Python.

## Key Concepts
- Images treated as numerical arrays
- Frames as time-ordered visual data
- Basic media processing using Python

## Technologies Used
- Python
- imageio (v3)
- NumPy

## How It Works
1. Multiple PNG images are read as NumPy arrays.
2. Each image acts as a single frame.
3. Frames are combined and encoded into a looping GIF.

##OUTPUT
<img width="695" height="413" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4adb3414-d59a-4e3d-bb00-58513e7c9dc0" />

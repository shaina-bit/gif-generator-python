# GIF Generator using Python 🐍🎞️

This project demonstrates how static images (frames) can be read, processed,
and combined into an animated GIF using Python.

## Key Concepts
- Images treated as numerical arrays
- Frames as time-ordered visual data
- Basic media processing using Python

## Technologies Used
- Python
- imageio (v3)
- NumPy

## How It Works
1. Multiple PNG images are read as NumPy arrays.
2. Each image acts as a single frame.
3. Frames are combined and encoded into a looping GIF.
